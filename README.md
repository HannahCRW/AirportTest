Descriptive commit message "I give up for tonight" you could have put "Fuck this bullshit I'm going home"

You have planes and airport tests in the same file. This is difficult to navigate and reason about. It's a mess.

You over thought the problem. You need at most 3 classes, Airport, Plane and bonus points for Weather.

You are close, IMO you should start from scratch it might be easier. Aim for something simple

```
airport.land(plane)
```

Ditch the includes, your plane and airport has all the methods associated with weather.

```
plane.stormy?
airport.stormy?

```
Does it make sense for a plane to be stormy? NO!

It's worth doing again, if this doesn't click you wont be able to progress.
